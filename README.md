# Snake-Game

This is a classic snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food, causing it to grow longer. The game includes a score count and features a dark aesthetic with a tiled look.

## Prompt

I used the following prompt in ChatGPT to generate the game file and implement the Snake game using prompt engineering:

1. Imagine you are a game developer. Please generate a classic snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and it grows longer. The game should have a score count.
2. The game should be styled to have a dark aesthetic with tiles. The snake should be gray in color with each tile of the body using a different shade of gray and slim black borders. Add a background shadow with gray color. The food of the snake should be neon green in color with shadows.
3. It should be a web-based game and use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It should also be responsive and placed in the center of the screen.
4. Please provide all the code in one file and give steps to run it.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `SnakeGame.html` file in a web browser.
